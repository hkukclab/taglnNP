# SUMMARY
The nucleus pulposus (NP) in the intervertebral disc (IVD) arises from embryonic notochord. Loss of notochordal-like cells (NCLs) in humans correlates with onset of IVD degeneration, suggesting they are critical for healthy NP homeostasis and function. Comparative transcriptomic analyses identified expression of progenitor-associated genes (T, GREM1, KRT18 and TAGLN) in the young mouse and non-degenerated human NP, with TAGLN expression reducing with aging. Lineage tracing using Tagln-CreERt2 mice identified peripherally-located proliferative NP (PeriNP) cells in developing and postnatal NP that provide a continuous supply of cells to the entire NP. PeriNP cells were diminished in aged mice and absent in puncture-induced degenerated discs.  Single-cell transcriptomes of postnatal Tagln-CreERt2 IVD cells indicate enrichment for TGF-β signaling in Tagln descendant NP sub-populations. Notochord specific removal of TGF-β/BMP mediator Smad4 results in loss of Tagln+ cells and abnormal NP morphologies. We propose Tagln+ PeriNP cells are potential progenitors crucial for NP homeostasis.
